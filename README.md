Initial version of my baseball script, but for Alfred. It works by pulling in game data based on the
abbreviation of a specific team. The teams are looked up based on the abbreviations used in baseball. ie NYY, SF, CHC, etc.

Depending on the game status, different information is displayed.

The workflow was made using [deanishe's](http://www.deanishe.net/alfred-workflow/tutorial.html) Alfred library.

######To-do
